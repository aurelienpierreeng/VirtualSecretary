    Mostly intended for text parsing functions that get fed unchecked text inputs from the web.
    In that case, some really bad XML or super-long log files can make the parsing loop hang forever.
    This decorator will skip them without breaking the loop.

    Args:
        s: number of seconds

    Returns:
        the output of the function or None if it timed out.
